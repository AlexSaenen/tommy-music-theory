			<h4>The Major Scale</h4>
		</div>
		<p>
			The <strong>major scale</strong>, known modally as the ionian scale, is one of the most important scales in western music.  The major scale is a seven note scale and is therefore referred to as a heptatonic scale.  You might recognize this scale in solfege as Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do.

			The <strong>C major scale</strong> is the only major scale with no sharps or flats, and it consists of the notes ascending and descending: [C, D, E, F, G, A, B].  If you play all of the white notes on the piano from C to C an octave higher, you will be playing the C major scale.
		<p>
			The <strong>formula</strong> for a major scale is <strong> whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step</strong>. For example, in the C major scale, C to D is a whole step, D to E is a whole step, E to F is a half step, F to G is a whole step, G to A is a whole step, A to B is a whole step, and B to C is a half step.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use this major scale formula to put the scale in other <strong>keys</strong>.  For example, if you wanted to get the major scale in the key D, you would start on D and use the same formula: [WS, WS, HS, WS, WS, WS, HS].  The D major scale consists of the notes: [D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#].  The note of the key you are in (in this case D) is called <strong>the tonic</strong>, <strong>the root</strong>, or <strong>the tonal center
			</strong>.

			In practice people don't usually use this formula to find the major scales in other keys.  Instead people usually memorize <strong>key signatures</strong>, which I will talk about in a future lesson.
