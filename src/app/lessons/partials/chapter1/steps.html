			<h4>Whole Steps and Half Steps</h4>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now that you know the names of the notes, you need to understand how to relate the notes to each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			One way to do so is to use <strong>whole steps</strong> and <strong>half steps</strong>, also known as wholetones and semitones respectively. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A <strong>half step</strong> is the smallest distance in traditonal western music.  It literally means one note away.  Some examples of half-steps are E to F, C to C#, or (going down) G to Gb.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <strong>whole step</strong> means two notes away and is equal to two half steps. Some examples of whole-steps are E to F#, C to D, or (going down) G to F.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Whole steps and half steps are the basic building blocks of scales, intervals, melodies, and chords.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note: </strong> Notice that there are no sharps and flats (or black notes) between B and C and between E and F.  This means, a half step up from E is F. F is actually synonymous with E#, and E is synonymous with Fb.  Similarly, a half step up from B is C.  Therefore, C is synonymous with B#, and B is synonymous with Cb.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Also Note: </strong> I know it is confusing, but since it is common practice to think of the piano centered around 'middle C', I made the piano in this example's lowest note C.  All of the following lessons will have the piano starting from C.
