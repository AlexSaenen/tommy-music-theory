I started this project in the AngularJS class that I took at NYCDA, so it is also in the AngularJS-Apr-2016 repository.

To view this project, clone the repository, then run

$ npm install

$ bower install

$ gulp serve

To start the node rest api:

Open up a new terminal window and start mongo

Open up another terminal window and run:

$ npm start

It is still a work in progress.  I hope you enjoy!
